Node.js Mentorship Program

My reason for desiring to join the mentorship program is to increase my awareness and skill with using
Node.js in a production environment. I've attended an online bootcamp, learned how to build full stack
web applications and in a recent assessment, I found that I didn't know as much as I believed about Node.
My singular focus is to grow into a developer who can contribute to and benefit humanity as much as
possible. This mentorship program seems to be a great opportunity move in this direction.
